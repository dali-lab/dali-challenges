# DALI Unity Challenge üï∂

## Overview
AR/VR has been on the rise and if you're interested in this type of fun, this is the perfect challenge for you! You will be using __Unity3D__ to create a project and show us something cool! (Also, if you're more comfortable with using __Unreal Engine 5__, go ahead!)

## Objective
In this challenge, you will use [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) to create a Unity app. This could mean a 2D/3D game, AR app, VR app, or anything else along these lines. The contents of the app is completely up to you -- be creative! üòâ

**‚ùó‚ùó Important! Please submit a built version of your project along with your submission (.apk, .exe, .app, etc.)! If you do not do so, it will be much more difficult to evaluate your submission.**

## Instructions üìã

1. Decide whether you want to tackle a 2D/3D game, AR app, or VR app.
2. Complete the __Setup__ section below.
3. Import some assets, make some objects, write some scripts, and have some fun!

## Setup
### Unity Basic Setup (must do!)
1. Make a Unity account and download¬†[Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). Make sure you login to your Unity account through Unity Hub.
2. Download a Unity version! If you are unsure about which version to use, we would recommend going to **Unity Hub ‚Üí Installs ‚Üí Add** and using the recommended release (the current one should be **2021.3.1f1**). You can also go to¬†[Unity's download archives](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)¬†and download a version there, if you would like.
    1. Make sure you add **Android Build Support** when installing the Unity version.
        1. Open the dropdown to the left of **Android Build Support** and double-check that both **Android SDK & NDK Tools** and **OpenJDK** are selected.
3. If you haven't set up a Unity license, we will do that now!
    1. Click on the **Settings** icon ‚Üí **License Management ‚Üí Activate New License ‚Üí Unity Personal ‚Üí The company or organization..."**
4. In Unity Hub, create a new project with the template¬†**3D (URP)**.

### AR/VR Quest Setup (if applicable)
* Here are some resources for setting up VR if you would like to tackle it on your own. Use this¬†[link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/configuring-project-for-xr.html)¬†as a guide to set up the XR system for Unity. You can also use this wonderful [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGYtahQjmWQ&ab_channel=Valem) for setting up VR in Unity.

### AR/VR Tools (if applicable)
1. __Vuforia__ is a SDK (Software Development Kit) for creating AR apps in Unity. Documentation and installation instructions can be found [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html).
2. __ARKit__ is Apple's version for creating AR apps in Unity. Documentation found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@4.1/manual/).
3. __ARCore__ is Google's version! Here's the [resources](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android)!
4. Feel free to use the Unity [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) to import free assets into your project -- just make sure to credit it! üôâ

## Tips
* We are looking for an app that is functional and demonstrates understanding of Unity basics and C# scripting. We are also looking for code that is clean and concise.
* Unity is a very powerful software that has a wide range of tools and applications. It might be a good idea to focus on a few elements that you are most interested in that demonstrate your skills. Some elements might include networking, animation with scripts, generative design, object interactions, physics systems, shaders, particle systems, etc.

## Building
**‚ùó‚ùó Important! Please submit a built version of your project along with your submission (.apk, .exe, .app, etc.)! If you do not do so, it will be much more difficult to evaluate your submission.**
* Building your project should be a straightforward process in Unity. go to **File ‚Üí Build Settings**, and switch to the appropriate target platform for your app.
* Once your platform has switched, press the **Build** button, and save the file to somewhere you can find it.

## Some Random Project Ideas üëΩ
* 3D data visualization
* Storytelling through a 2D platformer
* Exploring virtual and interactable environments
* Re-creation of a sport/activity/game
  * ChessVR, Golf Simulator, Mario, FlappyBird, Tetris, etc.
* Creating a digital book
* Here is an [example](https://github.com/songjon93/Dashboard_DALI) of a past project!
Make something fun and interesting! The more creative you get with this challenge, the better! If you have any questions feel free to email the DALI Lab at [applications@dali.dartmouth.edu](mailto:applications@dali.dartmouth.edu). Good luck! üöÄ
