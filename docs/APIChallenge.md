# DALI API & Platform Challenge üîå

## Overview
So you know what an [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api) is, and you heard that many companies such as [Slack](https://api.slack.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/partner/api-docs), [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers) all have their own APIs. Further more, there seems to be [developer](https://cloud.google.com/) [platforms](https://messengerdevelopers.com/) [everywhere](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa)? As a budding developer, you've been itching to *something* build with them... And this is your chance!

## Objective 
In this challenge, you will use **2-3 APIs and/or platforms** to create something interesting! At least 1 API/platform you use must be something you've never built projects with before, but who said you can't be adventurous and try 3 brand new technologies? 

If you know **JavaScript**, we recommend that you write your API challenge using that.

An example of this challenge is the [CS 52 Slack Bot that gives you Yelp recs](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/dartmouth-cs52.github.io/blob/master/assignments/sa/slack-bot/index.md), but you can do better of course üòâ

## Instructions üìã
1. Find 2-3 cool APIs/platforms.
2. Brainstorm an idea that ties them together nicely. 
3. Code.

## Tips
* For poorly-documented but still interesting APIs, try using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test what kind of data it returns.
* Go beyond just tutorials and starter code!
* You can also build out a frontend that incorporates data from multiple APIs! Consider an interactive web app using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) or mobile app built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### An incomplete additional list of APIs for inspiration üç≠
* [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/)
* [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar/)
* [Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
* [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/)
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
* [Here](https://apilist.fun/) is a list of miscellaneous ones from the web, a quick search will show you a lot more!

### Another incomplete list of platforms to get started üõ§
* [Messenger](https://messengerdevelopers.com/)
* [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa)
* [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/watchos/) 

The more creative you get with this challenge, the better! If you have any questions feel free to email the DALI Lab at [applications@dali.dartmouth.edu](mailto:applications@dali.dartmouth.edu). Good luck üöÄ
