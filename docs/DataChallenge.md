# Data Challenge ðŸ“ˆ

Not a front-end or back-end fan? Not feeling like recreating social media? Feeling a little adventurous and creative? This is the challenge for you.

### Overview

In this challenge, we've compiled a dataset related to a fictional superstore! We'll be asking you to both describe the data, as well as to show us your specific skill set and creativity! 


### Guidelines

The data is retail sales data at a fictional superstore located in the `Sample - Superstore` CSV file in the `data` folder. There are two parts to the challenge: data visualization and creativity.

## 1. Data Visualization
Describe the dataset given with three or more data visualizations. These can be maps, histograms, line graphs, 
combinations of those, or anything else. It can be a time-series, or an interactive plot.

Think, if you could only show someone these graphs to describe most of the data, what graphs would you choose.

Design matters, making this beautiful matters.

The sky is the limit!

Feeling lost? Here are some of our favorite tools for data visualization in the front end:
    - [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a phenomenal Javascript library that makes web visualizations incredibly easy and powerful
    - [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is another powerful Javascript visualization library
    - Python's [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) is a classic - easy to use, and runs straight on the terminal!

## 2. Free-Form Creative Challenge
This second part is more free-form, and allows you to showcase YOUR specific skillset.

Here's a chance to showcase your data science skills!

Model this data! Predict some outcome, make some claims, show your work, analyse it statistically, and tell us your thinking all the way through. You can use machine learning, deep learning, statistical analysis, linear models, or anything else that you want to use. Whatever interests you, go for it!

Be creative, think big, and report your findings in a clean, clear way!

Looking for where to start? Here are our favorite frameworks and ML tools:
    - Python [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a great place for beginners and advanced alike. An amazing, comprehensive framework that is both easy to start with, and extremely deep.
    - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) from Google, is another popular Machine Learning framework - has great support for working with deep learning and neural networks
