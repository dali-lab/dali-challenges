# Web Dev

## Theme: Outer Space

This year's theme is outer space! This theme is meant to serve as an inspiration for your websites‚Äîthe theme can be interpreted in aesthetic or functional ways. At the end of the day, the theme is there to help inspire you to come up with fun ideas, but we are developers, so we aren't going to doc you if you don't have amazing UIUX. TDLR: have fun with the theme but don't stress about it. 

## Websites for Inspiration

* [Dribble Space](https://dribbble.com/tags/space_website )
* [HackDartmouth 2023's Site](https://www.hackdartmouth.org/)

## Submission Format

The application form will ask you to write a description for each of your coding samples and to provide links to GitHub repos (like this one!). We **highly encourage** you to deploy all code samples, and especially your developer challenge (more info on how to do that below). For each sample, also include: 1) a video walkthrough of what you made and 2) instructions on how to run your code locally. These should be included in your repo's README.

Not sure where to start with deployment? That's A-OK! Here are some free resources:
