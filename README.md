# DALI Developer Challengesüë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

![](docs/imgs/dali-mondays.gif)

There are several challenges you may complete as a DALI applicant. To be considered as a lab member, you must complete **at least one** of the challenges. You should choose whichever you feel best showcases your skills and interests.

These challenges allow you try your hand at some design, some coding, and the ins and outs of an essential concept used in software development ‚Äî version control. We'll be using git and GitHub (the site you're at now!) to learn how to manage multiple people working on the same document at the same time ‚Äî all while having the ability to backup and revert your work. If this is all new to you, don't worry! We'll start from the beginning and build from there.

If you get stuck, don't be discouraged! If you have any questions, we encourage you to email us at applications@dali.dartmouth.edu or stop by Sudikoff 007 during DALI Open Lab Hours (sign up for a slot using the Calendly links on our webpage!).
## What to Submit üìã

Show us your coding skills! As a part of your application, we‚Äôll ask you to submit 3 coding samples that you are proud of and think are representative of your skills! We also ask you to write a paragraph for each when you submit discussing what you created, what went well, etc.

One small catch: **at least one** of your samples has to be one of our DALI Developer Challenges. These challenges help emulate some of the real work we do in DALI, and give us an opportunity to see how well you work with guidelines. While we love collaboration, DALI Developer Challenges should be completed individually.

The other submissions can be projects you've worked on or code that you have written. We look for these submissions to be creative projects. These can be side projects that you've worked on outside of class, something you learned while prepping for this application, or a final project from a CS class that does open-ended projects (like cs52, cs63.01, cs65, cs98, and more). We like to see these open-ended submissions as they demonstrate a passion for coding and give us a unique way to learn about your interests and abilities!

Here are some ideas for side projects to get you started: a to-do list website, a jeopardy board, a basic blog or sticky note app, a basic weather app, a meme generator, an informational page. The opportunities are endless! Don't feel like you need to create something crazy complex. Anything that reflects your interests and learning abilities is awesome.

Though we appreciate seeing non-class coding samples to better understand your development interests and experiences, we also recognize that not everyone has the time, ability, or experience to pursue side or personal projects outside of class. Therefore, while we prefer to see those kind of open-ended submissions, you may also submit code from CS class assignments that you are particularly proud of. If you feel you have not been able to pursue the types of projects listed above (for any reason), please make us aware in your submission. Our application process is holistic.

**TLDR:** please submit the following in your application

1. One of DALI Challenges (details below)
2. Two code samples of personal, side, or class projects

## Submission Format
The application form will ask you to write a description for each of your coding samples and to provide links to GitHub repos (like this one!). We **highly encourage** you to deploy all code samples, and especially your developer challenge (more info on how to do that below). For each sample, also include a video walkthrough of what you made and instructions on how to run your code locally; these can be included in your repo's README.

## All DALI Challenges üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We have a couple different challenges. The first is the [Basic Webpage Challenge](#basic-webpage-challenge-). If you've never worked with webdev or built a website before, start here!

For those with some experience with webdev, we also have the [API Challenge](#api-challenge-) and the [Social Media Challenge](#social-media-challenge-). These challenges exist as an opportunity for you to display your knowledge and skills of web development, so please choose the challenge that you think best represents your abilities. Specifically if you have taken cs52, we recommend trying one of these.

For those with some experience in AR, VR, XR, or Unity development, we also have the [Unity Challenge](#unity-challenge-). This challenge exists as an opportunity for you to display your knowledge and skills of Unity and AR/VR/XR. Please choose this challenge if you're specifically interested in working on AR/VR/XR/Unity projects at DALI.

Lastly, we have an optional [Data Challenge](#optional-data-challenge-). This is for people who might be interested in big data or have taken QSS classes and want to show their skills. If you have familiarity in this area (or want to learn!), consider trying this. Note that you are still expected to submit one of the other challenges above; this would count as one of your additional code samples. You will not be penalized for not submitting this challenge. Our application process is holistic. If you're interested in doing data work more largely, consider applying for the Data Team (linked in the application form).

Please note that each of these challenges are for the same role within DALI. Most of our devs work on full-stack applications, but we also often work on VR and other specialty projects. Regardless of which challenge you submit, you will be considered for the same role as a dev.

### Basic Webpage Challenge üê≠

Start here if you're a beginner to webdev!

We'd love to learn more about you, so we'd like you to design a web page telling us about yourself! Build your page using html/css/js (follow details [here](./docs/website_challenge.md)). Be creative and adventurous! If you are really passionate about writing, add some blog posts, if you really enjoy photography, integrate your 500px portfolio, and maybe if you love to travel, include a cool map visualizing all of the places you have visited. Your design should tell us something about your personality, so consider this when you make choices about the design, layout, and various components of your website.

#### Overview

Your page should include the following information:

* A picture of yourself
* Your name
* Where you‚Äôre from or where you live
* A short bio telling us about yourself (you might include/mention: design/programming applications you know/like, what you enjoy most about UI/US design/development, why you‚Äôre excited to work with DALI.)
* Something interesting/fun/random about yourself :smile:

**Inspiration**

Below are some examples of awesome pages that DALI Lab members have created that you could base your personal pages on.
